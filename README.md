## Routers

When we have a multiple pages in our project we can use the Routers to make the navigation between the pages
React Router is a library that allows us to make the navigation at a simple way

### What is it?

Whit a library of Routing we can have a lot of URLs to show so components, and then block to access to meny pages

#### Links

Usually we use `<a>` tag to make the link to the some page, but with Raect Router we use special tag `<Link>` or `<newLink>`
This is to have a better performance
In Links tag intead of use href property we need to use To property
#### Location

Is a way of make a state of the page and hes function is `useLocation()`
Your properties are:
`Hash`: is the URL with the hash
`Pathname`: is the URL without the hash
`Search`: is the URL with the search
`State`: is the URL with the state
`Key`: is the URL with the key
